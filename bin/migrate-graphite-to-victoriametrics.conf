# Configuration file for migrate-graphite-to-victoriametrics.sh
#
# This file contains patterns for metrics that should be excluded from migration.
# Each line contains a SQL LIKE pattern that will be used to filter out metrics
# from the migration process.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Pattern format: SQL LIKE syntax
#   % matches any sequence of characters
#   _ matches any single character
#
# Examples:
#   carbon.%                    # Exclude all carbon internal metrics
#   gauge.app.%                 # Exclude all app metrics
#   stats_counts.statsd.%       # Exclude statsd internal counters
#
# Default exclusions:
# - Internal Graphite/Carbon metrics
# - Internal StatsD metrics
# - Short-lived app and action queue metrics (recreated quickly)

# Graphite/Carbon internal metrics
carbon.%

# StatsD internal metrics
statsd.%
stats_counts.statsd.%

# Per-action/app metrics of limited historical value
gauge.app.%
gauge.action_queue.%
stats_counts.action_execution%
