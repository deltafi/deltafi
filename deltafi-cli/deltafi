# _readlink()
#
# Usage:
#   _readlink [-e|-f|<options>] <path/to/symlink>
#
# Options:
#   -f  All but the last component must exist.
#   -e  All components must exist.
#
# Description:
#   Wrapper for `readlink` that provides portable versions of GNU `readlink -f`
#   and `readlink -e`, which canonicalize by following every symlink in every
#   component of the given name recursively.
