## [2.17.0] - 2025-05-12

### Added
- Added a `pinMatching` mutation that pins all complete DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added an `unpinMatching` mutation that unpins all pinned DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added a pinned flag to the `DeltaFilesFilter` to allow filtering by the pinned value
- Added an option to search by pinned on the DeltaFile Search page
- Compose: deltafi-core-worker can be added via site/values.yaml:
```yaml
---
deltafi:
  core_worker:
    enable: true
    replicas: 1 # Or as many instances as you want
```
- Compose: deltafi-core-actions can be scaled via site/values.yaml:
```yaml
---
deltafi:
  core_actions:
    replicas: 2 # Or as many instances as you want
```
- TUI: HTTP client allows internal DNS mapping to remove the need for changes to /etc/hosts
- TUI: `site/compose.yaml` can be used to override or extend the compose orchestration
- TUI: Compose orchestration creates required data directories and creates the Docker DeltaFi network if it does not exist
- TUI: Compose orchestration automatically detects and configures local user ID, group ID, and docker group ID
- TUI: Ingress command has a progress bar
- TUI: Ingress command will upload multiple files concurrently

### Changed
- Compose: Docker UI now uses `/orchestration` path instead of `orchestration.<fqdn>`
- TUI: Compose orchestration no longer needs to place domains in /etc/hosts
- UI sidebar links to new Docker Dashboard location
- TUI: No dependencies on legacy CLI or compose scripts for operation of compose stack
- When configured for local storage, perform minio deletes directly on the filesystem 

### Fixed
- When registering a plugin that has the same version but has flow plan changes, the hMD5 hash now correctly detects those changes
- Retry was not pulling the correct metadata for the Modify Metadata option
- Fix bug where egress metrics were not recorded when awaiting a read receipt 
- Remove internal retry from Http egress actions, fixing stream reuse issues. External Auto Resume should be used instead. 
- TUI: Container based builds in the docker environment

### Removed
- CLI: Removed `_api_v1` deprecated function

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Cleanup the Nginx internal mapping used for the CLI
- Added default properties for connecting to MinIO and Valkey

### Upgrade and Migration
- Compose docker-web-gui updated to 1.0.2-1
- HttpEgressParameters and DeltaFiEgressParamters removed: retryCount, retryDelayMs
