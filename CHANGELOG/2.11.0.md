## [2.11.0] - 2025-03-14

### Added
- Added an `insertBatchSize` property to configure the number of DeltaFiles to insert at once
- Added a method to ContentInput to get content by name
- Added an option to ModifyMediaType to detect by name only
- Added partition and node-specific disk metrics for minio and postgres 
- Compose: TimescaleDB with pg_squeeze extension
- Testing: Using custom timescaledb with pg_squeeze extension

### Changed
- System Properties are now edited in a Dialog and can better handle larger values
- DeltaFileCacheService now uses bulkInsert for new DeltaFiles from the saveAll method 
- Automatically reclaim space in delta_files, delta_file_flows, and annotations tables when dead records reach >20% of total table size using pg_squeeze. 

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with permissions causing cloned or created timed-data-sources not to appear in Data Sources Page. 
- Remove DeltaFile from the cache when an unhandled exception occurs to prevent inconsistent state from being saved
- Fix a race condition where missing or inactive data sinks were not properly handled
- Fix an issue that would prevent a DeltaFile from completing other transforms when one forked transform has errored
- Recheck delete policies after each batch to ensure they are still running
- Remove DGS queues when they have not written a heartbeat in over 5 minutes
- Have existing disk metrics check /data/deltafi instead of /data, since these can be on different partitions

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Increase speed of deleting DeltaFiles when there is no content present 
- Remove unused action number 
- Add compression to actions column in delta_file_flows
