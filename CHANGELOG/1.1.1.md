## [1.1.1] - 2023-09-15

### Added
- Added a `system-plugin` where flows and variables can be added and removed without a full plugin install
- Added a mutation, `removePluginVariables`, to remove variables from the system-plugin
- Include max errors and expected annotations in snapshots
- Added an options parameter to FeignClientFactory:build to allow connect and read timeouts to be set
- Configurable time-to-live duration for ETL Deltafiles table
- Added documentation for unit testing java actions
- Added javadocs to the `deltafi-action-kit-test` classes

### Changed
- Limit flow plan mutations to the system plugin. Attempting to add or remove flow plans to a plugin other than the system plugin will result in an error
- Change the `savePluginVariables` mutation to take a list of variables that is always added to the `system-plugin`
- Total Bytes on Dashboard now uses `totalBytes` instead of `referencedBytes`.
- Clickhouse ETL table renamed `deltafiles`
- Clickhouse Grafana charts are not loaded if clickhouse is disabled
- Clickhouse ETL table is partitioned to days to improve short range query performance
- Renamed ingress flows to normalize flows
- Sort events in action queues by action create date, so that requeued actions are moved to the correct place in line.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug on the Search page causing Booleans to be parsed incorrectly on page refresh.
- Fixed bug causing Date Picker to not respect UTC mode.
- Fixed database seeding issue on initial startup of `deltafi-auth`.
- Clickhouse flow-subflow chart had misnamed bytes graph
- Remove the `ingressFlowPlan` and `ingressFlow` collections if they are recreated after they have already been migrated to `normalizeFlowPlan` and `normalizeFlow` collections.

### Deprecated
- Clickhouse ETL table `deltafile` is no longer used

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Move flow information into structured object in snapshots
- Refactored API route layout
- Removed usage of the deprecated base test classes from the `deltafi-core-action` tests
- Software license formatter updated
- Update python library dependency versions
