## [2.43.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Added Parquet Analytics (Beta) - a new analytics system using Parquet columnar storage and DuckDB queries. This reduces database load by decoupling analytics from PostgreSQL, where analytics queries previously competed with runtime DeltaFi processing
- Added `deltafi-analytics` Go service for receiving, storing, and querying Parquet-based analytics
- Added three new Grafana dashboards: "Dataflow Analytics (Parquet Beta)", "Error Analysis (Parquet Beta)", and "Filter Analysis (Parquet Beta)"
- Parquet dashboards support filtering by multiple annotation key/value pairs simultaneously
- The `analyticsGroupName` system property is used as the default grouping in Parquet dashboards, but can be changed on the fly via dashboard dropdown
- Added system property `parquetAnalyticsEnabled` to enable the Parquet analytics collector (default: false)
- Added system property `timescaleAnalyticsEnabled` to control TimescaleDB analytics storage (default: true)
- Added system property `parquetAnalyticsAgeOffDays` to configure Parquet data retention (default: 30)

### Changed
- Renamed `metricsEnabled` system property description to clarify it controls VictoriaMetrics reporting
- Updated error handling for table lookup

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in documentation generation

### Upgrade and Migration
- Upgrade grafana to deltafi/grafana:12.4.0-3
- **Kubernetes**: New persistent volume `deltafi-analytics` required for analytics storage
- **Parquet Analytics Migration Strategy**: The new Parquet analytics system runs in parallel with TimescaleDB analytics during the migration period:
  1. Enable `parquetAnalyticsEnabled` to start collecting Parquet analytics alongside TimescaleDB
  2. Run both systems in parallel to build historical data and validate accuracy
  3. Compare the new Parquet dashboards against existing TimescaleDB dashboards
  4. A future release will switch the default dashboards to Parquet Analytics and deprecate TimescaleDB analytics
  5. A subsequent release will remove TimescaleDB analytics entirely
  Historical TimescaleDB data will not be migrated to Parquet.
- New system property `timescaleAnalyticsEnabled` defaults to the existing `metricsEnabled` value on upgrade, preserving current behavior
- Update to using KinD client 0.30.0
