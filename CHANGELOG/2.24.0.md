## [2.24.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- Added drill-down links from the Dataflow Analytics dashboard to the Error and Filter Analysis dashboard
- Added On-Error Data Sources, a new type of data source that automatically triggers when errors occur in other flows
- Added filtering options for On-Error data sources:
  - `errorMessageRegex` - Filter by error message patterns
  - `sourceFilters` - Unified filtering structure with optional fields:
    - `flowType` - Filter by source flow type (REST_DATA_SOURCE, TIMED_DATA_SOURCE, TRANSFORM, DATA_SINK)
    - `flowName` - Filter by specific flow name
    - `actionName` - Filter by specific action name that generated the error
    - `actionClass` - Filter by action class for cross-flow error monitoring
  - `metadataFilters` - Filter by source DeltaFile metadata key-value pairs
  - `annotationFilters` - Filter by source DeltaFile annotation key-value pairs
  - `includeSourceMetadataRegex` - Include matching metadata from source DeltaFile in error DeltaFile
  - `includeSourceAnnotationsRegex` - Include matching annotations from source DeltaFile in error DeltaFile
- Added GraphQL mutations for creating and managing On-Error data sources
- Added documentation explaining On-Error data source configuration and use cases with detailed filtering examples
- TUI: Added command support for on-error data sources
- TUI: `graphql` command to execute GraphQL queries against the DeltaFi GraphQL API.
- TUI: `deltafi postgres status` - Renders status information on the primary Postgres database
- TUI: `deltafi postgres migrations` - Lists flyway migrations for the primary Postgres database

### Changed
- Add filter to Error Analysis dashboard to hide items that were filtered due to Missing Subscribers
- Add filter to Filter Analysis dashboard to hide items that were filtered due to Test Mode 
- Child DeltaFiles now inherit the depth of their parent flow (parent depth + 1)
  - The existing `maxDepth` configuration now prevents infinite recursion across spawned children, not just within a single DeltaFile
- Revert raw analytic data storage to 3 days 
- TUI: data-source load-timed and load-rest consolidated to single load command

### Fixed
- Boost the `event_annotation` clean-up batch size during start-up to 1000
- Fix failing method used to clean up event annotations table
- TUI: Fixed data source get and load commands to be symmetrical
- TUI: Fixed extraneous output on `deltafi postgres cli` exit
- TUI: Allow piping from `deltafi postgres eval` and `deltafi minio mc` commands

### Upgrade and Migration
- Database migration adds support for OnError data source configuration fields (negligible migration time)
- Upgrade python dependencies to match new base image: deltafi/python:3.13.5-0
  - pydantic 2.11.7
  - requests 2.32.4
  - urllib3 2.5.0
  - pytest 8.4.1
