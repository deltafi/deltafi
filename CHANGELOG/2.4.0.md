## [2.4.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- [action kit test - Java] New IngressResultAssert for verifying Timed Ingress actions
- Add Pivot by Annotation dashboard
- Added GraphQL endpoints and CLI command support to import/export of flow plans from the system-plugin (those created by the flow plan builders)
  - Export: export-system-plans / getAllSystemFlowPlans
  - Import: load-system-plans / saveSystemFlowPlans
- Added the ability to pin DeltaFiles so they won't be deleted by delete policies

### Changed
-  In compose, use the `.ingress.tls.enabled` setting to determine if NGINX should be setup with the SSL listener instead of automatically setting that up when the key and cert are present.
- [action kit test - Java] TransformResultsAssert now allows content index and annotations to be specified
- Detect extracted content types by file name in Decompress action
- CLI command `load-plans` renamed to `load-system-plans`

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in default format selection in Content Viewer
- Don't delete a parent deltaFile's content if its descendants may still be using it 
- Fixed bug on Filtered page when filtered action is not the first action.
