- [deltafi-python/test-kit] Improved message context for assertion errors generated by tests (#341)
- Changed the `cluster` command to check for the `DELTAFI_MODE` before wrapping `deltafi` commands to simplify switching between compose and kind.

### Fixed
- Fixed resume policy constraint to require at least one of dataSource, errorSubstring, or action
