## [1.0.6] - 2023-08-09

### Added
- Added filename search options to make regex and case-sensitive searches optional. For example: 
  ```graphql
  query {
    deltaFiles(
        filter: {sourceInfo: {filenameFilter: {filename: "stix.*", regex: true, caseSensitive: false}}}
    ) {
      deltaFiles {
        did
        sourceInfo {
          filename
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Test kit for DeltaFi Python TRANSFORM and LOAD actions
- Added -r flag to `deltafi registry add` command to replace previous tags with new one
- Added `api/v1/registry/repository/delete` endpoint to delete all tags in a repository
- Added `api/v1/registry/replace` endpoint to replace all tags in a repository with new tag
- Added the option to mark plugin variables as masked. Only users with `Admin` or `PluginVariableUpdate` roles will be able to see the masked parameter value 

### Changed
- gitlab-ci now only builds using packages and their versions in package.json
- FlowfileEgressAction record the HTTP response body in the error context now, instead of the error cause
- Internal docker registry is configured to load plugins via localhost routing.  Any plugin image loaded into the registry will be accessable for plugin install via `localhost:31333/<IMAGE NAME>`

- Fixed the logic used to determine if the FormatAction is complete when getting the content to send to the next action
- Fixed Errors Page not showing errors on all tab 
- Fix eslint broken pipeline by hard coding versions used "npm install eslint@8.40.0 eslint-plugin-vue@9.11.1"
- When a DeltaFile in an ERROR state has been acknowledged, clear the DeltaFile from the auto-resume schedule
- Clicking on an error message on the __By Message__ tab on the Errors page now filters on the associated flow.
- Throw exception and do not trigger disk space delete policies if the API reports 0 byte disk usage or total size
- Stop deleting batches in the disk space delete policy if the target disk space threshold has been reached
- "Failed writing body" error in CLI when events are generated
- Storage API now ignores invalid metrics and raises an exception if no valid metrics can be found for the time period.

### Removed
- Ingress removed for internal docker registry
