## [2.32.0] - 2025-09-10

### Added
- Gradle: `install` task for KinD will build docker images, install them in the KinD cluster, and perform a deltafi up to sync orchestration
- Gradle: `install` task for Compose will build docker images and perform a deltafi up to sync orchestration
- Gradle: `pushToKind` task added to docker builds in KinD mode
- Gradle: `syncKindPods` task added to docker builds in KinD mode
- Gradle: `syncComposeServices` task added to docker builds in Compose mode
- TUI: `deltafi up` for KinD now performs an image sync to detect rebuilt docker tags in development.  This mimics the behavior of `deltafi up` for compose
- Added search functionality to deltafi docs
- Added dynamic versions to deltafi docs
- The `Compress` and `Decompress` actions now support the `BZIP2` and `TAR_BZIP2` formats
- TUI: `config` command has `--no-start` flag that prevents a cluster from being started or synced after configuration changes 
- Added support for multiple concurrent fast delete workers per node to improve deletion throughput
  - Kubernetes: Configure via `deltafi.fastdelete.workersPerNode` in Helm values (default: 1)
  - Docker Compose: Set `FASTDELETE_WORKERS` environment variable (default: 1)

### Changed
- KinD image managment no longer uses localhost:5000 images
- KinD no longer needs sidecar registry containers
- KinD image caching consolidated and simplified
- Gradle: `configureKindCluster` task renamed to `startKindCluster`

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the active threads in the `ActionRunner` prevented the plugin application from exiting on a failed startup, leaving the plugin in a partially initialized state
- Fixed an issue where embedded docs and public docs (docs.deltafi.org) get out of sync.
- Fixed bug in KinD where "kind up" failed to set the admin password on the first attempt
- Bug with `deltafi up --force` that could still prompt interactively

### Removed
- Gradle: `dockerPushLocal` task removed

### Upgrade and Migration
- Update clustermonitor kubectl to 1.33.4
- Upgrade to golang 1.25.0
