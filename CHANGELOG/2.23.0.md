## [2.23.0] - 2025-06-23

### Added
- Added resume by error cause and resume by flow options to the GUI 
- Added the ability to query deltafiles by "Modified Date" or "Created Date" on the Search Page.  
- Added rate limiting support for REST data sources
  - Configure limits for FILES (number of files per time period) or BYTES (data volume per time period)
  - GraphQL mutations `setRestDataSourceRateLimit` and `removeRestDataSourceRateLimit` for managing rate limits
- Java plugins will have the task `install` which will build the plugin docker image locally and install it on a locally running DeltaFi

### Changed
- Dataflow Analytics + Error/Filter Analysis grafana dashboard facelifts - remove grid lines, set opacity to zero, remove transparent background 
- When performing a DeltaFiles - Search using annotations, the following options are now supported in the annotation search value (Gitlab-467):
  - If the value is `*`, the query will only check that the key exists (matches any value)
      - E.g., `*` will match `null`, `"""` (empty string), or `abcd`
  - If the value contains `*`, the query will match if the value is LIKE the provided value, treating `*` as a wildcard
    - E.g., `abc*3` will match `abc123`, but not `abcdef`
  - If the value starts with `!`, the query will add a `NOT` to the comparison
    - E.g., `!abc*3` will match `abcdef`, but not `abc123`
  - When an `!` or `*` is not present, the default behaviour remains an exact match
    - E.g., `abc` will only match `abc` 
- Reduce window for analytic annotation changes from 3 days to 1 day. Any annotations added within 1 day of an ingress event will be applied to that ingress event.
- Analytics Grafana charts now refresh continuously instead of waiting 5 minutes between updates
- Egress-Sink: Updated error message when DeltafiMetadata HTTP header is not found

### Fixed
- Improve appearance of zero values in analytics grafana charts
- Update the Action Kit Version of the System Plugin to match the DeltaFi version
- Improvements to the TUI command help and command grouping
- TUI: Kubernetes `up` command will now respect the site `values.yaml` file

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Clean up JUnit dependencies to use BOM
- Updates to the documentation
  - New installation procedures for compose systems
  - General cleanup
  - TUI documentation
