## [2.28.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added
- Actions may now log messages which are saved into the DeltaFile and available for view on the TUI and UI (Raw DeltaFile)
  - Log messages with a severity of `WARNING` are flagged and searchable by the UI/TUI
  - An `ErrorResult` automatically generates a log message with a severity of `ERROR`
  - Limited to the Java action kit initially
- A user may now add a note to a DeltaFile. This is accomplished using a log message with a severity of `USER`, and the new GraphQL endpoint `userNote`. This new endpoint requires the new permission `DeltaFileUserNote`
  - Adding a user note is supported through GraphQL initially
  - Searching for DeltaFiles with a user note is supported through the TUI initially
- New core action, `Warning` allows for logging of messages with the `WARNING` severity

### Changed
- Changed the core-scheduler service to set the UNIQUE_ID and APP_ID environment values directly in the compose file instead of relying on the entrypoint which is overridden in `CoreDevelopment` mode

### Fixed
- Allow DeltaFile `messages` to be null
- Fixed the name of the migration file for updating the index `idx_delta_files_stage_in_flight`, which was silently being ignored, and  fix the same migration to check for the index before attempting to drop it
- Fixed a bug where retrying publish errors left the previously errored flow in an in-flight state

### Upgrade and Migration
- New user permission, `DeltaFileUserNote`
- Added migration to add new fields  to `delta_files` table: `warnings`, `user_notes`, and `messages`
