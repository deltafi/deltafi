## [2.7.0] - 2025-02-10

### Added
- Added support for Content-Type override on Upload page 
- [deltafi-core] Create an event when a plugin is restarted due to an action execution timeout (GitLab-415)

### Changed
- Set the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container` annotation on the `core-scheduler` and `core-worker` pods

### Fixed
- Fixed sorting on the Errors and Filtered pages.
- [deltafi-core] Rebuilding flows (e.g., after a plugin variable update) now properly clears a flow's INVALID state
- Validate analytic events for required fields to prevent database insert exceptions
- Processing Report now showing file counts instead of byte counts in the "Processed Files by Data Source" table
- Fixed the long-running actions check bug where the same execution time was used for all the dids under an action.
- Fix null pointer exception on requeue of malformed DeltaFiles 

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Increase timescaleDB chunk size from 1 day to 1 week to ensure typical queries use a single chunk for better performance
- Improve Annotation by Data Source and Pivot by Annotation dashboard performance

### Upgrade and Migration
- To change the timescale chunk size the tables must be recreated and migrated. This can be a lengthy migration depending on the size of these tables.
- `jq`, `yq`, and `lazydocker` are now included in distro files
