## [2.7.1] - 2025-02-13

### Changed
- Changed the `ActionExecutionTimeout` to bounce a specific pod instead restarting the entire deployment
- Only register a new or upgraded plugin once; it does not need to be repeated for every pod or when pods restart

### Fixed
- No longer populates Data Source on Create Auto Resume Rule dialog for summary pages 
- Fixed Search Page Calendar CSS after upgrade to Vite 
- Fixed a bug where events generated from the GrafanaAlertCheck and IngressStatusCheck were missing timestamps preventing them from being found for display 
- Fix unsafe threading model when actionThreads is set to >1 in the application.yaml 
- Replay checks whether first flow is in still test mode, instead of blindly assigning the old state, except in cases where a child was replayed, in which case the test mode will be carried forward
- [core-actions] Updated the Decompress action to use the `long` data type for all archive file size checks

### Upgrade and Migration
- Added `registration_hash` column to `plugins` Postgres table
