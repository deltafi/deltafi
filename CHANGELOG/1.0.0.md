## [1.0.0] - 2023-06-21

### Fixed
- Querying for the distinct annotation keys no longer fails if a DeltaFile is missing the `annotationKeys` field

### Deprecated
- All releases prior to 1.0.0 should now be considered deprecated and
  no longer supported.  All bug fixes and features will be only added
  to the 1.0.0 tree.

### Upgrade and Migration
- For upgrades to 1.0.0, the `deltafi-passthrough` plugin flows should be disabled
  and the plugin should be uninstalled.  The plugin is now built-in and the external
  plugin will cause conflicts.  This is not a concern for new installations
