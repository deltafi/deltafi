## [1.0.2] - 2023-06-29

### Added
- Added a query to get the set of annotations that are expected on a DeltaFile but not present 
- Added the `pendingAnnotationsForFlows` field to the `DeltaFile` graphql schema
- New mutation `applyResumePolicies` allows recently added auto resume policies to be retroactively applied to any oustanding DeltaFiles in the ERROR stage (whicn are still resumable)
- New user role `ResumePolicyApply` in the `Resume Policies` group grants permisson to execute the `applyResumePolicies` mutation

### Changed
- Clarified documentration that the `flow` in an auto resume policy refers to the DeltaFile's sourceInfo flow. I.e., the ingress or transformation flow name

### Fixed
- Nodemonitor used RAM calculation fixed

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Update the DeltaFiles in a new thread when expected annotations are changed to prevent blocking the graphql response
