## [1.1.7] - 2023-10-18

### Added
- Added a `system-plugin` where flows and variables can be added and removed without a full plugin install
- Added a mutation, `removePluginVariables`, to remove variables from the system-plugin
- Implemented new Flow Plan Builder 
- Added new core action, `DeltaFiEgressAction`, for egressing data directly to another DeltaFi instace.
- Added a query, `filteredSummaryByFlow`, to get a summary of filtered DeltaFiles grouped by flow
  ```graphql
    query {
      filteredSummaryByFlow {
        offset
        count
        totalCount
        countPerFlow {
          flow
          count
          dids
        }
      }
  }
  ```
- Added a query, `filteredSummaryByMessage`, to get a summary of filtered DeltaFiles grouped by flow and the filter cause message
  ```graphql
    query {
      filteredSummaryByMessage {
        offset
        count
        totalCount
        countPerMessage {
          flow
          message
          count
          dids
        }
      }
    }
  ```
- Grafana dashboard 'Clickhouse flow by annotation' that filters on flow and a generic annotation key.  This will allow graphing based on any flow/single annotation key combination
- Support for collecting multiple DeltaFiles for processing by a transform, load, or format action
- Add a check for long-running actions (>5 seconds)
- Foundational work for plugin-delivered timed ingress actions. This is not yet meant for production use.
- New clustermonitor pod that polls kubernetes app metrics and records per-app CPU (in milli-cores) and RAM utilization
- New metrics produced:
  - `gauge.app.memory` tagged by pod container name
  - `gauge.app.cpu` tagged by pod container name
- `System Overview` dashboard updated with the following graphs:
  - `Pod RAM Utilization Over Time`
  - `Pod RAM Utilization` pie chart
  - `Pod CPU Utilization Over Time`
  - `Pod CPU Utilization` pie chart
- New GraphQL query endpoint `resumePolicyDryRun` allows a preview of how many DeltaFile errors might be auto-resumed by a new resume policy
- New user role `ResumePolicyDryRun` in the `Resume Policies` group grants permisson to execute the `resumePolicyDryRun` query

### Changed
- Limit flow plan mutations to the system plugin. Attempting to add or remove flow plans to a plugin other than the system plugin will result in an error
- Change the `savePluginVariables` mutation to take a list of variables that is always added to the `system-plugin`
- Cadence update for all libraries minor versions. 
- Remove spring-cloud dependency and manually set up kubernetes client
- Update documentation to reflect Ubuntu compatibility and revised system prerequisites (disk space, AVX instruction set 
- Reduce default requeue time from 300 to 30 seconds. This was previously raised to mitigate double-queuing issues when an Action took longer than the requeue period to process.
- `cluster`: Plugin configuration simplified to minimally plugin name with an optional git URL

### Fixed
- Fixed bug on the Search page causing Booleans to be parsed incorrectly on page refresh.
- Fixed an error where periodic revalidation of invalid flows persisted missing variable errors that were no longer relevant.
- Clickhouse dashboard 'Clickhouse Metrics' filters correctly on flow for all charts
- Add null check to cold queue logic to protect against bad data and flows that are no longer running
- DeltaFiles in an ERROR stage that have been acknowledged can be deleted by the disk space delete policy. 
- Collect entry locking that resulted in multiple collections for the same set of conditions instead of a single collection
- Deprecation issues in `gradle-plugin` with Gradle 8.4
- Do not issue automatic requeues for long-running tasks that are still being processed by an Action
- Remove the `ingressFlowPlan` and `ingressFlow` collections if they are recreated after they have already been migrated to `normalizeFlowPlan` and `normalizeFlow` collections.
- Fixed bug on Flow Plan Builder caused by the addition of `TIMED_INGRESS` actions.
- Bootstrap/install: Issue with using snap to install kubectx on Ubuntu

### Removed
- Grafana dashboard 'Clickhouse flow/subflow' removed

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Software license formatter updated
- Refactored nodemonitor configuration in values.yaml to simplify and remove exposure of environment variables.
