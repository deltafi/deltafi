## [2.18.0] - 2025-05-19

### Added
- Added System map to App  
- TUI: `deltafi dashboard` command
- TUI: default site files will be created automatically if they are missing:
  - site/values.yaml (Configuration parameters)
  - site/compose.yaml (Compose overrides, compose orchestration only)
  - site/compose.plugin-dev.yaml (Compose overrides for plugin development)
  - site/compose.core-dev.yaml (Compose overrides for core development)
- TUI: `data-source list` lists the states of all actions that are downstream from the data source
- TUI: `data-source` state subcommands (start/stop/pause) will take a `-a`/`--all-actions` flag that will apply the state change to all actions that are downstream from the data source
- TUI: `deltafi properties` command supporting `list`, `get`, and `set` subcommands

### Fixed
- Compose stack: nodemonitor needs local user and group to access file system
- Compose secrets need to be quoted to prevent `$` character from being misinterpreted
- FIX: Compress and Delay actions were needlessly republishing metadata 
- TUI: `deltafi data-source get PLAN` needed a format flag to correctly display results
- Restore deprecated HTTP egress parameters to maintain backward compatibility. 
- TUI: Init command respects new value of deployment mode when it is changed

### Removed
- Removed Disk Space delete policies and replaced them with a single system property, `diskSpacePercentThreshold`, to simplify configuration

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Handle core endpoint client resets and SSE session creation race issues, do not log stack trace unless logger is configured for DEBUG mode. 
- Propagate original exception to custom HttpExceptions 
- Move cleanup of `event_annotations` table to a stored procedure to prevent paging.
- Compute flow input content and metadata instead of storing it. 
- Remove republishing of metadata from egress action.
- TUI: `deltafi status` command refactored for usability

### Upgrade and Migration
- This upgrade removes Disk Space delete policies. The `diskSpacePercentThreshold` system property will be set with the minimum global (i.e. no data source set) maxPercent found in the enabled Disk Space delete polices.
