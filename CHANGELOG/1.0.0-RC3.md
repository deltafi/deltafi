## [1.0.0-RC3] - 2023-06-02

### Added
- `deltafi-docker-registry` pod added to cluster
- `local.plugin.registry` will resolve to the local plugin registry in repository configuration for plugins
- Added a new field, `expectedAnnotations`, in the transform and egress flows containing a set of annotations that are expected when a `DeltaFile` goes through the flow
- Added new mutations to set the expected annotations in transform and egress flows
   ```graphql
   # Example mutation setting the expected annotations on a transform flow named passthrough
   mutation {
     setTransformFlowExpectedAnnotations(flowName:"passthrough", expectedAnnotations:["readBy", "readAt"])
   }
   # Example mutation setting the expected annotations on an egress flow named passthrough
   mutation {
     setEgressFlowExpectedAnnotations(flowName:"passthrough", expectedAnnotations:["readBy", "readAt"])
   }
   ```
- Serialized Errors Page State 
- Transform and Load actions can delete metadata
- Allow Tranform and Load Actions to create annotations (formerly known as indexed metadata)
- Add stricter validation for events received by core from actions

### Changed
- View All Metadata dialog now uses new top-level metadata key to display cumulative metadata
- System Overview dashboard limits list of ingress and egress flow totals to 10 items each
- Delete policies will not remove a `DeltaFile` until all expected annotations have been set
- Updated UI libraries.
- Use `errorCause` and `errorContext` to detail an invalid action event, and verify in test
- Loki retention rules limit retention of noisy cruft logs
- Ensure mongo migrations are only run once
- UI now prefetches pages. This reduces load times when switches pages
- Rename indexedMetadata to annotations and indexedMetadataKeys to annotationKeys
- Updated FeignClientFactory to support URIs passed to interface methods

### Fixed
- Replay toast message now displays the new DID of the replayed DeltaFile
- Updated text color of the DID column of a selected row on the Search page
- Allow unselecting of rows on the Search page
- Fixed bug in Domain and Enrichment viewers
- `cluster` did not recognize "17" as a valid Java 17.x version

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- DeltaFile: Merge protocol stack content, metadata, and deletedMetadataKeys into actions
- Fix tests that would occasionally fail because of non-deterministic sorting of equal OffsetDateTimes

### Upgrade and Migration
- Added new custom grafana image deltafi/grafana:9.5.2-2
