## [2.25.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- Added time search parameters to the Error and Filter Pages 
- [integration test framework] When using `ExpectedContentData`, the expected value may now be base64 encoded, and also supports additional substitutions using RegEx in `extraSubstitutions`
- TUI: `integration-test` command
- TUI: topic command

### Fixed
- Fixed core actions docs not showing in public docs
- Fixed issue in colorized TUI JSON output where escaped strings were unescaped

### Upgrade and Migration
- *NOTE: POTENTIAL METRICS LOSS!*
  - A previous bug that was not maintaining the `event_annotations` analytics table correctly might leave the system with an excessively large table that cannot be pruned in a timely manner by the cleanup task. A migration was added to truncate the table, which could cause metrics to be lost for any In-flight DeltaFiles when upgrading. To avoid losing metrics for In-flight DeltaFiles, disable ingress when upgrading, and allow all DeltaFiles to complete before starting the upgrade. Be sure to re-enable ingress after the upgrade is finished.
- Bump to the latest KinD patch release
