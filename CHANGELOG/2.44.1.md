## [2.44.1] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- Unified flow output dialog with three tabs: Metadata (default), Input Content, and Output Content
- Metadata diff view showing added/removed/modified entries
- Different icons in flow table and graph to indicate content/metadata changes: file icon (unchanged) vs file-pen icon (modified)

### Changed
- Plugin SNAPSHOT builds now use timestamped tags (e.g., `2.44.1-SNAPSHOT-20251217-143022`) to ensure each build gets a unique image tag
- Plugin gradle builds automatically prune old SNAPSHOT images before building (keeps 3 most recent)
- Made plugin jar builds reproducible by excluding build timestamp and normalizing file order
- Increased maximum zoom level on full system map from 2x to 5x
- System map layout now groups disconnected dataflows into separate visual clusters
- System map uses barycenter ordering to minimize edge crossings instead of alphabetical ordering

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where `./gradlew install` in plugin projects would not restart the plugin container even when the image changed (now uses unique tags so core naturally detects the change)
- Fixed issue where `./gradlew install` did not respect the overridden docker image name in the Gradle `docker { }` configuration
