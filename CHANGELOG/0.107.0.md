## [0.107.0] - 2023-04-19

### Added
- New `priority` field in `ResumePolicy`, which is automatically computed if not set
- Generate an event and snapshot prior to running an upgrade
- Docker compose mode introduced as a beta proof of concept
  - From the `compose` directory execute `./compose start`
  - To use the CLI you must unlink the cluster command (execute `deltafi-cli/install.sh`) and add 
    `export DELTAFI_MODE=STANDALONE` to `deltafi-cli/config`
- `appsByNode` endpoint added to core to get docker-based apps-by-node manifest
- `app/version` endpoint added to core to get docker-base version list
- `DockerDeployerService` added to manage plugin installs in compose
- `DockerAppInfoService` added to support `appsByNode` and `app/version` endpoints

### Changed
- Resume policy search is now in `priority` order (the highest value first)
- The resume policy name stored in the DeltaFile `nextAutoResumeReason` is no longer cleared when the DeltaFile is resumed
- Monitored status checks for k8s will only run in CLUSTER mode
- CLI updated to accommodate standalone compose mode

### Fixed
- Resume policy search will consider the number of action attempts and the policy `maxAttempts` during the policy search iteration loop, not after finding the first match
- sse endpoint X-Accel-Buffering turned off to fix stand alone sse streaming

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Clean up public methods in Java Action Kit Input and Result interfaces

### Upgrade and Migration
- Added `priority` to `resumePolicy` collection
