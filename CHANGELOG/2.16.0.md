## [2.16.0] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Added ability to ACK ERRORS from the Search Page 
- Added an `annotateMatching` mutation that annotates all DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added a `cancelMatching` mutation that cancels all in-flight DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added a `replayMatching` mutation that replays all DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added a `resumeMatching` mutation that resumes all errored DeltaFiles matching a given `DeltaFilesFilter`
- Added `AnnotationConfig` to rest and timed data sources which allows annotations to be added to the DeltaFile by core directly from the flow configuration if not already present
- Added `Metadata` to rest and timed data sources which allows metadata to be added to the DeltaFile by core directly from the flow configuration if not already present
- Added check for client/server clock skew
- Added a `system-flow-plans` command for importing and exporting system flow plans

### Changed
- Change pods/containers to run as non-root user: nodemonitor, clustermonitor (GitLab-449)
- System Properties edit dialog now respects dataType and displays the input associated with that dataType. 
- Improved lazydocker integration with compose via `deltafi compose status` command
- Updated the descriptions for the `actionExecutionTimeout` and `actionExecutionWarning` system properties

### Fixed
- Set chunk times on analytic tables for timely removal of old chunks 
- CHANGELOG underscores wrapped
- Fixed an issue where the action parameters were defaulting to an immutable map causing an error setting default parameter values
- Prevent Delete Policy names from using `=` or `;` because those characters are prohibited from metric tags; also ensure that `minBytes` is not negative
- Fixed list-plugins command
- When saving or importing delete policies that contain errors only detected by the deltafi-core, alter the user on the UI and present the errors
