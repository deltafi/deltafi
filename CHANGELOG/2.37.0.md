## [2.37.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- Added a post startup method to the core-scheduler that re-installs any plugins that should be installed when running in compose
- Added a system property, `egressEnabled`, that can be used to turn off DeltaFile egress globally. When false, egress is disabled, pausing all DeltaFiles at `DataSinks`. Egress action queues are drained and the actions are ineligible for requeue until egress is re-enabled. Resetting the property to true will allow the actions to requeue.
- UI: Added switch on Data Sources page to toggle ingress
- UI: Added switch on Data Sinks page to toggle egress

### Changed
- Changed resume to skip egress action errors when egress is disabled, this applies to auto-resume rules as well

### Fixed
- NodeJS dependency tree for docs dropped glob as a transitive dependency.  Moved the code to use fast-glob directly.

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Do not create the `PendingDeleteCleanupScheduler` service when using external storage

### Upgrade and Migration
- Upgrade lazydocker distro to the latest version
