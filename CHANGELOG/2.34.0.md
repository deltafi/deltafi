## [2.34.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Adds a system status check to show any actions which have cold queued items, and how many items are cold queued.
Uses new system properties `checkColdQueueMinimumGrowing` (defaults to 10,000) and `checkColdQueueWarningThreshold`
 (defaults to 75,000)
- Added error handling to NGINX in compose to show more a Service Unavailable page in the UI when upstream services can't be reached instead of the NGINX default error pages.
- Added an option to configure the content storage bucket name using the `values.yaml` by setting the `deltafi.storage.bucketName` field
- Added an option to use a specific DeltaFi API URL per TUI command with the `--api-url` flag (highest precedence)
- Added an option to configure the TUI with an environment variable called `DELTAFI_API_URL` to use a specific DeltaFi API URL instead of detecting it (second in precedence) 
- Added an option to configure the TUI to use a specific DeltaFi API URL with authentication in `.deltafi/config.yaml` (URL here has the lowest precedence). See examples below:
```yaml
context:
  api:
    url: https://local.deltafi.org
  authentication:
    basic:
      username: <USERNAME>
      password: <PASSWORD>
# for cert authentication use the following      
#   cert:
#     keyPath: <path to key file>
#     certPath: <path to cert file>
```

### Changed
- Changed the deltafi-core setup to automatically forward all unknown routes (i.e. 404s) to the UI. This allows new UI routes to automatically work and replaces the generic Whitelabel error page with the UI not found page
- Changed the deltafi-core startup probe to use the versions endpoint to speed up the response
- Changed the health-checks in compose to reduce the time waiting for containers to start
- Changed the loki settings in compose to reduce the loki container startup time
- CI Docker images now build with docker buildx and caching instead of Kaniko
- Changed the DockerConfiguration to configure SSL in the docker client when the server certs are available

### Fixed
- Fixes a bug when attempting to restore a system snapshot that contains links (GitLab-497)
- Fixed an issue where NGINX had errors after an upgrade in compose. This change also allows NGINX to start without depending on any other services.
- Fixed an issue where plugins may not have access to the certs directory when running in compose
- Fixed a bug where the env file generated by the `deltafi ssl load` command had the incorrect path for the tls.key/tls.crt files
- Fixed the initial display of "Bytes deleted by policy" on the System Performance dashboard, which previously would not show any data until a policy was selected
- Fixed an issue where the action queue check was failing due to inadvertently picking up rate limit keys in ValKey

### Removed
- Removed deprecated Kaniko from CI

### Tech-Debt/Refactor
- Adjusted the GraphQL schema file extensions to speed up the `deltafi-core` startup 
- Refactored the core-action egress tests to improve reliability in CI and make it easier to see why the test failed
- increase test coverage for multiple onError scenarios 

### Upgrade and Migration
- [deltafi-python] Upgrade deepdiff python dependency from 7.0.1 to 8.6.1 (GitLab-496)
